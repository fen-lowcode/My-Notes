**==Our memory is a characteristic, Quality, Attribute of the information we receive.==**

And ==**the way we impart the information with the quality of good memory== is ==through the way we construct it.**==

**==We can't just Read and Hear things and instantly know, our brain needs to make effort to digest and to make sense of that information.==**

And **==the harder and more effort our brain does to construct an information==**, the **==longer it will retain it compare to just constructing the information in a fast way.==**

For example, Using Artificial Intelligence to generate information for studying deep concepts. 

when the information generated by the AI is more easily to digest, the brain will do less effort to construct the information thus making it insecure and easy to forget.

**==The Brain remembers the experience it have by constructing and digesting a concept than by just recalling the concept itself.==**

Which means, ==**active learning is the way to go.**==


**Daniel T. Willingham - " Memory is the residue of thought "**

#### **Here are the 4 most principle to improve memory.**


##### ==The spacing effect==  

if you don't use it you'll lose it

Is a learning technique that recalling an information after some time is an effective way of retaining memory.

By repeating and spacing out the information that individuals learn, they can better recall that information in the future.

![](spacingeffect.avif)

But the issue is when an information is not naturally recalled then it is harder to recall those information especially if it's hundreds of information, it's going to be overwhelming, so spacing effect is the least impact but yet important and effective



##### ==The Generation Effect== 

Actively generating knowledge is more memorable

Our brain remembers things better if it needs to do more work to gain the information. since our brain holds memory longer when by the time the information was gained was effortful


| Passive      | Generative                       |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Reading      | Re-writing from scratch          |
| Listening    | Pausing + summarzing             |
| Highligthing | Turning into practice challenges |
| Copying      | Paraphrase                       |

By this way, the brain not only gain information in passive way but the brain is also actively wiring itself and making efforts to construct the knowledge which in result outcomes into more memorable network.

But know when it's enough, no need to be perfect, just  know when you got what you need.

##### Spacing Effect + Generation Effect 

* Write a Monday to Sunday schedule
* Identify the times to review & space out
* Ask: How will i review?
* Write your normal method
* Ask: What's one more generative approach?


___

##### **==The Testing Effect==**

Testing self makes you remember better, The way you test yourself matter a lot for memory retention.

The right way to test your knowledge and information that you gained is through test that matches the right level that you need to apply this knowledge.

A practice exam may not be testing you in away that you need to suit you up for a long term career.

Tests should be level matched and fills and finds gaps that you can apply to real world.

The test are there so that you can find and fill gaps that you are not aware yet, so failing test is not a big deal, it helps you grow and eliminate concepts and key details that you did not have covered yet.

**==Testing, find errors and gaps. and see if you are aware of it or not.==**

> [!Gap finding]
> As early as possible test yourself with challenges that can highlights your gaps.

> [!Fill Gaps]
Now fill the gaps with Spacing + Generation effect.


>[!Avoid Recognition over Recall]
When You discovered what you lack from an discovered Gap, Recognizing the answer to that gap is not active recalling. ask yourself **"Why i didn't get it right at the first place?"**

>[!Avoid Overconfidence]
> If you felt unconfident giving an answer, that means there's a gap. look for the Gap. and if confident, then test it.

##### ==Higher-Order thinking==


**"Being able to think about a new information in a way that fits into a network is what higher-order thinking and higher-order learning is"**

A term used for the specific processes and types of thinking that create long-lasting knowledge and deep understanding of information.

Information that are relevant and irrelevant, when you study a topic that is relevant to your goal, a knowledge that is part of a more bigger network. it will be likely to stick in memory.

When a topic is irrelevant, it will be harder to remember since it's not connected into any bigger network that can be put on top off.


**How to do higher-order thinking & learning in action**

| Do's        | Dont's       |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| Integrated  | Isolated     |
| Big Picture | Fact to Fact |
| Network     | Memorize     |

1. Creating analogies. Gathering facts and relating each to a bigger network. make a story of it.
2. Teaching, The way you teach matters. Use teaching to organize all of the thoughts.
3. Mind mapping, Non linear Notes (Like Obsidian)


**==Questions to self for higher-order thinking==**

* ==when learning something, you to almost constantly zoom out to see the relevance of the information to the big picture, A bigger Network.== **(Almost Constantly)**

* ==Simplify What you are learning, making something feel more obvious makes it irrelevant to memorize  since a simplified information stored in a big network  is bulletproof yet needs to be backup by testing effect== **(Do it after every concept)** 

 * ==Delay Creating relationships, with each new information always group the information in the big picture. too much delay will only get unnecessary hard and annoying to group them altogether. comparing something that you don't understand with what you already know, and the other things that you've learnt, deepens your understanding of it.== **(Close to zero as possible)**

## **Summary**

* **Spacing Effect** is for refreshing studied knowledge time to time to extend the memory about it.
* **Generational Effect** is for actively pursuing the brain to study a topic to retain memory.
* **Testing effect** is for actively testing the knowledge gained from a topic and searching and filling gaps that are missed.
* **Higher-Order thinking** Is the process of grouping relevant information gained and relating it within a network so the networks supports those information's lifetime.
