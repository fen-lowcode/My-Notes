>It's important to understand what **GCC** and **G++** compilers are and what they do, as they are two of the main tools used in malware development.

Gaining a solid understanding of how these compilers work under the hood provides both broad and deep insight, allowing you to identify and apply the most effective programming designs for developing complex malware.


A **compiler** is specialized software that translates **source code**—written in a high-level, human-readable programming language—into **machine code** that a computer's processor can execute.


In other words, it converts readable instructions like `int main()` into low-level binary instructions that the CPU can understand, ultimately producing an **executable file**.


**GCC** and **G++** are compilers for the **C** and **C++** programming languages, respectively.


The **C** programming language was **developed by Dennis Ritchie** in the 1970s at **Bell Labs**. 

It was originally created to write the **UNIX operating system**, and it has since become the foundation for many modern programming languages and operating systems due to its speed, portability, and low-level control.


On the other hand, the **C++** programming language was **created by Bjarne Stroustrup** in the early 1980s, also at Bell Labs.

It was designed to add **object-oriented programming** and other features to C **without sacrificing its efficiency**. 

C++ was originally called "**C with Classes**".


C gave us control over the hardware while C++ gave us control over complexity.

Both GCC and G++ have their compilation system and [[Why it's important to understand the compilation system]].
