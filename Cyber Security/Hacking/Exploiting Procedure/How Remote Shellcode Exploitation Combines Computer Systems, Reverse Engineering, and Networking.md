#hacking #networking #shellcoding 


Exploiting remote systems through shellcode involves a **combination of three core fields**:

---

##### 1. **Computer Systems**

- Memory layout: stack, heap, registers, virtual memory

- Word size (32-bit vs 64-bit), endianness

- Calling conventions (how functions use memory)

- Protection mechanisms: ASLR, DEP/NX, stack canaries

**Why it matters**:  
You need to know _where_ your payload lands and _how_ to execute it.

---

##### 2. **Reverse Engineering**

- Disassembly and binary analysis (Ghidra, IDA, objdump)

- Finding gadgets (ROP), syscall usage, function offsets

- Understanding program flow and vulnerabilities in compiled binaries


**Why it matters**:  
You extract logic, offsets, or function calls from unknown or black-box programs.

---

##### 3. **Networking**

- TCP/UDP basics, ports, sockets, packet structure

- Tools: `nmap`, `netcat`, `wireshark`, `socat`

- Protocol behavior (HTTP, FTP, etc.)

- Remote exploitation over open ports

**Why it matters**:  
You deliver the exploit over the network and interact with services.

---

##### Example Workflow (Combining All 3)

1. **Scan for open ports** (networking)

2. **Identify vulnerable service** (networking + reverse engineering)

3. **Analyze binary if available** (reverse engineering + systems)

4. **Craft exploit with payload** (systems + shellcode)

5. **Send it over the network** (networking)

6. **Catch shell / escalate** (networking + privilege understanding)

To exploit systems remotely with shellcode, you need:

- **System internals knowledge** to control memory

- **Reverse engineering** to understand or bypass logic

- **Networking** to deliver payloads and maintain access
