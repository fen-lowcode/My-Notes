#### Binary Patching

* For those the term is unfamiliar, is the process of applying small changes and modifications to a binary file, usually in order to change its behavior.

* By modifying data or code, the user can change certain values in the program or specific instructions, and adjust the binary to their desired outcome.

* The process of making changes to a binary and modify its instruction flow is called “patching a binary”. Hackers do this to bypass built-in protections, or to make the program behave in a different way to make the exploit development process go more smoothly.


**Knowledge to perform binary patching:**

- CPU architecture and ISA.  
    Know x86, x86-64, ARM, or MIPS instruction sets and registers.

- Assembly language.  
    Read and write assembly for your target ISA.

- Opcode encoding.  
    Translate instructions to bytes and back. Learn operand sizes and prefixes.

- Calling conventions and ABI.  
    Follow how functions pass arguments, return values, and use the stack.

- Binary formats.  
    Understand ELF, PE, or Mach-O layout, headers, sections, and segments.

- Virtual vs file addresses.  
    Map file offsets, RVAs, and runtime addresses.

- Relocations and imports.  
    Handle GOT, PLT, import tables, and runtime linking issues.

- Disassembly idiosyncrasies.  
    Spot misdisassembly, overlapping instructions, and data-as-code.

- Debugging and dynamic analysis.  
    Use gdb, x64dbg, WinDbg, or lldb to trace execution and validate patches.

- Patching techniques.  
    Learn inline overwrite, trampolines, thunking, and code cave use.

- Packets and obfuscation.  
    Detect and reverse packers, packer stubs, and anti-tamper layers.

- Checksums and signatures.  
    Find and update CRCs, hashes, or digital signatures that break on change.

- Tooling and automation.  
    Use IDA, Cutter, Ghidra, radare2, hex editors, and IDA/Ghidra scripting.

- Testing and safety.  
    Run patches in snapshots or VMs. Use instrumentation and compare behavior.

- Build and linker behavior.  
    Know how compilers and linkers produce code, padding, and alignment.
