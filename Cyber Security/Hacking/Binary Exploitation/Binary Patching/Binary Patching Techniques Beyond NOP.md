**Abstract:**  
Binary patching is the practice of modifying executable code at the instruction or data level to alter program behavior. While NOP (No Operation) patching is commonly used to bypass conditional checks, advanced reverse engineering often requires a variety of techniques to effectively manipulate software. This document summarizes key patching methods beyond NOP, with explanations and practical examples.

## 1. Conditional Jump Modification

**Description:**  
Instead of removing a check, the conditional branch itself is altered. This can invert a program’s logic.

**Example:**

- Original: `je fail` (jump to failure if equal)
- Patched: `jne fail` (jump to failure if not equal)


**Use Case:**  
By flipping a conditional jump, the program executes the “success” branch even when inputs are invalid.

---

## 2. Immediate Value Patching

**Description:**  
Modifying hardcoded constants or immediate values within instructions.

**Example:**

- Original: `cmp eax, 123`
- Patched: `cmp eax, 0`

**Use Case:**  
By changing magic numbers, the program can bypass numeric checks or validation routines.

---

## 3. Function Return Patching

**Description:**  
Altering a function to immediately return a desired value.

**Example:**

- Inject: `mov eax, 1; ret` at the start of a function

**Use Case:**  
Used to force password or license checks to always succeed without executing the original logic.

---

## 4. Code Injection

**Description:**  
Adding new instructions into a binary to override or extend functionality.

**Example:**

- Inject instructions to set a variable or jump to a different code section.

**Use Case:**  
Allows the reverse engineer to override complex logic without removing the original instructions.

---

## 5. Control-Flow Redirection

**Description:**  
Modifying call or jump targets to redirect execution.

**Example:**

- Patch `call check_password` to jump directly to the success message.


**Use Case:**  
Useful in layered protections to skip multiple validation functions at once.

---

## 6. Data Patching

**Description:**  
Changing values in memory rather than modifying code instructions.

**Example:**

- Overwriting a checksum stored in a global variable to force validation to succeed.    

**Use Case:**  
Effective when code performs integrity or checksum verification; the program executes normally if expected data is patched.

---

## 7. Multi-Byte or Arithmetic Instruction Patching

**Description:**  
Altering arithmetic or logic instructions to change program behavior.

**Example:**

- Original: `sum += pw[i] ^ 0x12`
- Patched: `sum += 0`

**Use Case:**  
By modifying computations, input checks like checksums or obfuscated password verification can be bypassed.

---

## 8. Anti-Obfuscation

**Description:**  
Simplifying obfuscated or self-modifying code to make patching easier.

**Use Case:**  
Removes opaque control flows (e.g., jumps through registers) that complicate static analysis or patching.

### **Conclusion**

While NOP patching is simple and effective for bypassing single instruction checks, professional reverse engineering requires a combination of the above techniques. Understanding and applying these methods allows analysts to manipulate complex binaries while preserving program functionality, bypassing layered protections, and safely testing software logic.
