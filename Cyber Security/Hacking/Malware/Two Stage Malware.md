>[!important How are shellcodes correlated with two-stage methods?]

Shellcode is a small piece of machine code used as a payload in exploits. It is typically written in assembly and injected into a vulnerable program to execute arbitrary code such as spawning a shell, downloading additional payloads, or escalating privileges.

Two-stage methods split the payload into two parts:

**Stage 1 (Initial Loader):**

- Minimal shellcode that fits into limited memory space.
- Performs basic tasks such as downloading or reading the second stage.
- Commonly uses syscalls like `read`, `recv`, or `mmap`.


**Stage 2 (Main Payload):**

- Larger and more complex malicious code.
- Could be a reverse shell, privilege escalation tool, or malware loader.


**Correlation:**

- Stage 1 addresses size constraints by acting as a loader for Stage 2.
- Stage 1 can be obfuscated or polymorphic for stealth.
- Modularity allows reuse of Stage 1 across multiple exploits.

**Example:** 
An exploit injects Stage 1 shellcode into a vulnerable service, which calls `recv()` to load Stage 2 over a network socket. Stage 2 executes as a full-featured payload.

>[!important Could Stage 2 be a full malware executable?]

Yes. Stage 2 can be a full malware binary such as:

- **Windows:** PE file
- **Linux:** ELF file
- **macOS:** Mach-O file


**Capabilities may include:**

- Keylogging
- Data exfiltration
- Persistence
- Rootkit functions
- C2 communication


**Loading methods:**

1. **Drop and Execute** – Writes malware to disk and executes it.
2. **Reflective Loading** – Loads directly into memory without touching disk.
3. **Process Injection** – Injects into a legitimate process to evade detection.

#### !important Reflective Loading

Reflective loading is the in-memory loading of an executable without writing it to disk. This is common in fileless malware and advanced persistent threats (APTs).

**Process:**

1. Read binary (PE/ELF) into memory from a network, encrypted blob, or resource.
2. Parse headers and sections manually.
3. Resolve imports and relocations.
4. Jump to the binary’s entry point.


**Advantages for attackers:**

- No disk footprint.
- Evasion of antivirus and EDR tools.
- Payloads can be updated dynamically.


**Common use cases:**

- Credential theft
- Remote access
- Data exfiltration
- Lateral movement

#### !important Downside of Reflective Loading

**Volatility:**

- The malware only exists in RAM.

- Shutting down or rebooting clears it.


**Persistence workarounds:**

1. **Memory Injection into Persistent Processes** – Keeps malware alive while the process runs.

2. **Scheduled Reflective Re-loading** – Loader re-executes on boot.

3. **Living off the Land (LotL)** – Uses legitimate system tools to reload malware.

4. **Remote Re-loading** – Connects to C2 server to re-download payloads after reboot.


**Defensive advantage:**

- A simple reboot can remove non-persistent infections.

- Memory forensics tools like Volatility can detect in-memory malware.
