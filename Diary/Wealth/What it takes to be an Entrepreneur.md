1.  **Kill Delusions.**

	  ***"Expect failure, Accept that success doesn't come easy"***

	*  ==Most of the successful stories that you saw is Survival bias.==

		* Because selling something to feed your delusion is highly profitable.
		* Successful Businesses aren't because of a one perfect idea.

	* ==In order to become successful in business, you have to burst this bubble of life.==
	
		* Or.. it will burst for you, it would be way more damaging.

	* ==Successful people are not Business Gods that get it right every time.==

2. **Replace your friends.**

	 ***"Outgrowing old friends is a painful, yet inevitable part of the growth process "***
	 
	* ==Have a co-founder, they are in the trenches with you==
	* ==Replace friends that aren't helpful and find like minded people and never look back.==

3. **Rethink Money.**

	  ***"Carry $10,000 dollars in cash wherever you went"***
	  
	  * ==Changed attitude towards money, there's always tons of money waiting to be grabbed, don't be afraid to spend it. as a business owner.==
	  
	  *  ==Stop thinking of money as hard to get, View money as a tool to build wealth.==

4.  **Maximize efficiency.**

      ***"Think ahead, Maximize efficiency, Get systems and processes in place"*** 
    
	* ==Not everyone is comfortable about the stress of running business compare yo working at jobs everyday== 

	* ==When you work on a normal job, you only focus on the day ahead, after work you relax. however for a business owner it's very hard to switch off because you know you are solely responsible of keeping the money flowing.==
	
	*  ==But for us that have a burning desire for business, there's is a way to maximize efficiency.==

		1. Putting in place great systems and processes.
		2.  The most stress comes from when your business is reliant on people. because what if your business is booming but one of the key people suddenly leaves.
		3. Systems and processes is like a big manual to your business that everyone can follow.

5. **Become a wolf, have a pack**

	***" Pick your wolf strategically, share your success along the way"***

	1. ==Find someone who is better than you in a specific area, this will significantly boost your success.==
