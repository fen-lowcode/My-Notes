#personal

I don't understand the way of my thinking, ==i don't know my true self== ==or the true essence of my soul. i think i do but i really don't know.==

But there's is one thing that i think i know and i will try going for,

It's that ==i wanted to be unique==, and ==respected==, i wanted to see myself  in the future who is ==someone far from who i am right now==.

I always tell myself that i wanted to die and yet afraid to die, because maybe i just ==don't know who i am.==

In this case the self, Am, I am will ==learn something new.== something to reach [[Self's Goal]]. 

==To build identity.==

The Self, Am, I am, will learn something new and ==turn this knowledge into a weapon== that the self ==can be proud of despite of not knowing who i really am.==

==The Self, Am, I Am, will face [[Obstacles]] but surely, Am will prosper and surpass them all.== 

And i will ==call my self i AM.==

==As Am, I Am. Am.==
