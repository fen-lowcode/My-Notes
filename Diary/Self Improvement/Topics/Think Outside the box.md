Let us take a closer look at the problem. Look at this simple math equation and try to solve it:

20 * ________+ ________ = 65535

This equation is easy to solve, but did we think about how many different ways are there to solve it?

What limitations were you given for this exercise? - None.

So, why didn't you think to add more digits or to replace the given arithmetic operations?

Welcome to the hacker's way of thinking called:

"**`Outside the box`**."

So, why didn't we think like that? During this learning path, we will acquire more information that will help us find an answer. However, first, we have to understand the [[way of thinking]] we currently use. Make it clearer. Try to understand what we have to work on.
